This is going to define some structure for future book review website and app!
Yet, I don't know which technology to choose, actually. For a start point, I thought of designing basic book-related
entities, which can be considered as a book repository. Another benefit can be conceptualizing the whole process and
classes and their behavior.

Let's write down what we want in general:
We have books, classifications, people, authors, translators, readers, reviewer, reviews, ratings, languages,
...[think of expansions].
Books have original title, ISBN, type,  genre, Dewey classification, cover image, edition, pages (last three are dependant),
...[think of expansion].
we have people as parent class and other classes for other people to do other things.
