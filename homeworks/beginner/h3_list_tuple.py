"""
1. we have a list of numbers (float or integer) named 'numbers_list'.
   define a function to process each number and separate even and
   odd numbers into two separate lists (excluding float and negative numbers).

2. define a function to make the equivalent tuple of odd and even
   numbers lists from the first exercise. (search the web for help if needed)

3. define a function to loop through the 'numbers_list' while reaching to a negative number.
   then return the index of the negative number and the negative number itself and also
   remove that number from the list.

4. define a function to calculate the sum of numbers in each of even and odd numbers list.
   (do not use loop for this, search the web if needed)

5. define a function to return the maximum and minimum number in 'numbers_list'.

6. define a function to return a new single list from odd and even numbers lists.

Happy Coding!
